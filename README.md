# todo-website
A simple Todo App built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript on the frontend, with a Node.js HTTP server (without Express) on the backend. It allows users to add and view tasks, stores todos in a JSON file, and serves all static files manually using Node’s built-in `http`, `fs`, and `path` modules.
